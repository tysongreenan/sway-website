            <h2>What does social media management actually include?</h2>
            <p>Social media management means someone else handles everything about your social presence—planning what to
                post, creating the content, publishing it at the right times, responding to comments and messages, and
                tracking what's working. Instead of spending hours every week trying to keep up with Instagram or
                Facebook, you hand that off to people who do this all day, every day.</p>

                <p>Between running your business and managing employees, social media keeps falling to the bottom of the

                <div class="faq-question">How much does social media management cost?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Our packages start around $1,000/month for basic management of 1-2 platforms. More
                    comprehensive packages with multiple platforms, more frequent posting, and content creation run
                    $2,000-$4,000/month. We'll recommend what makes sense for your business and budget.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How many posts per week do you publish?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">It depends on the platform and your goals. Typically, we post 3-5 times per week
                    on Instagram and Facebook, and adjust frequency for other platforms. More isn't always better—we
                    focus on quality and consistency rather than flooding your followers.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Do I need to provide photos and content?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">It helps to have some photos of your team, products, or workspace, but we don't
                    expect you to be a content factory. We can work with what you have, create graphics, source stock
                    imagery, and even coordinate photoshoots if needed.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Will the posts sound like my business?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">That's the goal. We spend time upfront learning your voice, your tone, and what
                    makes your business unique. You approve everything before it goes live, so nothing posts that
                    doesn't feel right to you.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What platforms should my business be on?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">It depends on where your customers spend time. Most local businesses do well on
                    Instagram and Facebook. B2B companies often need LinkedIn. Younger audiences might require TikTok.
                    We'll recommend what makes sense based on your specific situation—not what's trendy.</p>

                    <h3>How a <span>Kitchener coffee shop</span> built a loyal community on Instagram</h3>
                    <p>This independent coffee shop had 800 followers and posted sporadically. Their content wasn't
                        getting engagement, and they weren't seeing foot traffic from social media.</p>
                    <p>We developed a content strategy focused on behind-the-scenes stories, customer features, and
                        local partnerships. We posted consistently, engaged with the community, and ran strategic
                        collaborations with local influencers. In 9 months, they grew to 12.4k followers with an 8.7%
                        engagement rate, and 34% of new customers said they found them on Instagram.</p>
