            <h2>How is Facebook advertising different from Google?</h2>
            <p>Google Ads reaches people actively searching for something. Facebook and Instagram ads reach people based
                on who they are—demographics, interests, behaviors—even when they're not looking for you. You can target
                homeowners in Waterloo aged 35-55 who are interested in home renovations, or parents of toddlers in
                Kitchener who follow parenting pages. It's powerful for building awareness, generating leads, and
                retargeting people who visited your website. For many businesses, Facebook ads cost less per lead than
                Google.</p>

                <h3>"I boosted posts and got nothing"</h3>
                <p>The boost button is a trap. It's the simplest way to waste money on Facebook. Real results come from
                    properly structured campaigns in Ads Manager, not boosted posts.</p>

                <h3>"Ads Manager is overwhelming"</h3>
                <p>Campaigns, ad sets, audiences, placements, objectives—Facebook's advertising platform is confusing
                    even for marketers. You need someone who lives in there daily.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>"I don't have good creative"</h3>
                <p>Facebook and Instagram are visual platforms. Boring stock photos and text-heavy graphics don't cut
                    it. You need scroll-stopping creative that earns attention.</p>

                <h3>"I can't tell what's working"</h3>
                <p>iOS privacy changes broke a lot of tracking. Attribution is messier than it used to be. Without
                    proper setup, you're flying blind on what's actually driving results.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">How much should I spend on Facebook Ads?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Most local businesses start with $1,000-$3,000/month in ad spend. This gives us
                    enough budget to test different audiences and creative to find what works. Once we find winning
                    combinations, you can scale to $5,000, $10,000, or more. We'll recommend a starting budget based on
                    your goals.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between boosting and real ads?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Boosting is like throwing money at a post and hoping for the best. Real campaigns
                    in Ads Manager give you precise audience targeting, multiple ad formats, conversion tracking, A/B
                    testing, and optimization options that boosting doesn't offer. The difference in results is massive.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Do Facebook Ads still work after the iOS changes?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes, they still work well. Tracking is messier than it used to be, but Facebook's
                    algorithm is still incredibly powerful at finding the right people. We've adapted our
                    strategies—using conversion API, broader targeting, and better first-party data collection. Results
                    are still strong for our clients.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Should I advertise on Facebook or Instagram?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Usually both—they run through the same Ads Manager and we can show ads on both
                    platforms with one campaign. The data tells us where your audience engages more. For some
                    businesses, Instagram outperforms. For others, Facebook. We let the numbers decide.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How quickly will I see results?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">You'll see impressions and engagement within hours of launching. Leads typically
                    start coming in within the first week or two. But it takes 4-6 weeks of testing and optimization to
                    really dial in performance. The campaigns get better over time as we learn what works for your
                    specific business.</p>

                    <h3>How a <span>Cambridge fitness studio</span> filled their classes with Facebook Ads</h3>
                    <p>A boutique fitness studio needed to fill their new location fast. They'd tried boosting posts but
                        weren't seeing real results—just likes from people who would never actually show up.</p>
                    <p>We built conversion-focused campaigns targeting women 25-45 within 10km, tested multiple ad
                        creatives, and optimized for actual class bookings. In 6 weeks, they generated 1,847 leads at
                        $2.14 each, with an 18.2% conversion rate to paid memberships.</p>
