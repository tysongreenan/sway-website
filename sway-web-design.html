            <h2>What makes a good business website?</h2>
            <p>A good business website loads in under 3 seconds, looks great on phones, and makes it easy for visitors
                to take action—whether that's calling you, filling out a form, or making a purchase. It's not about
                flashy animations or trendy designs. It's about helping your customers find what they need and giving
                them a reason to choose you over the competition.</p>

                <p>From Toronto to Ottawa, and everywhere in between, we work with businesses across Ontario. Whether
                    you're in a major city or a smaller community, we bring the same level of expertise and dedication
                    to every project.</p>
                <p>We understand the Ontario market, work in your timezone, and can meet in person when it makes sense.
                    Most importantly, we build websites that connect with Canadian customers.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How much does a website cost?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Most business websites we build range from $3,000 to $15,000 depending on the
                    number of pages, features, and complexity. E-commerce sites typically start around $8,000. We'll
                    give you a detailed quote after our discovery call so there are no surprises.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How long does it take to build a website?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">A typical business website takes 4-8 weeks from kickoff to launch. Larger sites or
                    e-commerce projects can take 8-12 weeks. The biggest factor is usually how quickly you can provide
                    content and feedback—we never want to be the bottleneck.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Will I be able to update the site myself?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes. We build every site with a content management system (usually Webflow) and
                    train you on how to make common updates like changing text, adding blog posts, or updating your
                    hours. For bigger changes, we're always here to help.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Do you offer website hosting?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">We can host your site on fast, secure Canadian servers, or we can build it and
                    hand it off to your existing hosting. We recommend managed hosting because it includes security
                    updates, backups, and support—but the choice is yours.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What if I already have a website I want to keep?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">We can work with what you have. Sometimes a full redesign makes sense, but often
                    we can improve your existing site's speed, mobile experience, and conversion rate without starting
                    from scratch. We'll be honest about which approach is best for you.</p>

                    <p>An Italian restaurant came to us with a slow, outdated website that wasn't mobile-friendly.
                        Customers were bouncing before they could even see the menu.</p>
                    <p>We rebuilt their site from scratch with a focus on speed, mobile experience, and making it dead
                        simple to place an order. The results? Traffic tripled, load time dropped from 8.4s to 2.8s, and
                        online orders increased by 320%.</p>
