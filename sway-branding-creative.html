            <h2>What does branding actually include?</h2>
            <p>Branding is your complete visual and verbal identity. It starts with strategy—who you are, who you're
                for, and what makes you different. Then we create the tangible pieces: your logo, colour palette,
                typography, photography style, and tone of voice. A brand isn't just a logo file. It's a system that
                makes everything you do look and feel consistent, from your website to your business cards to your
                social media posts.</p>

                <h3>"My logo looks outdated"</h3>
                <p>You've been using the same logo for 15 years. It was made in Microsoft Word by your cousin. It
                    doesn't reflect the quality of your work anymore.</p>

                <h3>"Nothing looks consistent"</h3>
                <p>Your business cards use one colour, your website another, and your social media posts all look
                    different. There's no visual thread tying your brand together.</p>

                <p>Your industry is full of competitors with similar names, similar colours, similar messaging. Nothing

                <div class="faq-question">How much does branding cost?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">A logo-only project typically runs $2,000-$3,000. A full brand identity with
                    strategy, logo, colour palette, typography, and brand guidelines ranges from $5,000-$15,000
                    depending on scope and complexity. We'll scope your project specifically and give you a detailed
                    quote before starting.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How long does a branding project take?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">A logo-only project takes about 3-4 weeks. A complete brand identity typically
                    takes 6-10 weeks from kickoff to final delivery. The timeline depends on how quickly you can provide
                    feedback and make decisions—we work as fast as you can.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What if I don't like any of the concepts?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">It rarely happens because we do thorough discovery before designing anything. But
                    if it does, we'll figure out what's missing and develop new directions. We don't stop until you have
                    a brand you're genuinely excited about.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Do I own the final logo and brand assets?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes, 100%. Once the project is complete and paid for, you own everything we
                    created. We'll hand over all source files—you can use them however you want, forever, without
                    additional licensing fees.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Can you just refresh my existing logo?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Sometimes a refresh makes more sense than starting over—especially if you've built
                    recognition around your current mark. We'll give you an honest assessment of whether a refresh will
                    solve your problems or if you really need to start fresh.</p>

                    <h3>How an <span>Ontario tech startup</span> raised $2.4M after a complete rebrand</h3>
                    <p>This B2B SaaS company had a generic logo, inconsistent colors, and marketing materials that
                        looked like they were made in PowerPoint. Investors weren't taking them seriously.</p>
                    <p>We developed a complete brand identity—new logo, color system, typography, brand guidelines,
                        pitch deck design, and website. The rebrand positioned them as a serious player in their space.
                        Within 4 months, they closed a $2.4M seed round, and brand recognition among their target market
                        jumped to 89%.</p>
