            <h2>How does Google Ads work?</h2>
            <p>Google Ads puts your business at the top of search results when people look for what you sell. You only
                pay when someone clicks. Done right, you're reaching people at the exact moment they're ready to
                buy—someone searching "emergency plumber Kitchener" or "best Italian restaurant Waterloo" is a lot more
                valuable than someone scrolling through social media. The key is showing up for the right searches with
                the right message.</p>

                <p>You see clicks in your dashboard, but the phone isn't ringing. Something's broken—either you're
                    reaching the wrong people or your landing page isn't converting.</p>

                <p>Google's interface is confusing. Quality Score, ad rank, bidding strategies—you set something up but
                    have no idea if it's working or what to change.</p>

                <p>You used to get leads for $20, now it's $50 and climbing. Without proper management, Google Ads gets
                    more expensive over time while results decline.</p>

                    restaurants, home services, and more. We know what cost-per-click looks like in this market, which
                    keywords convert, and how to beat the national competitors bidding on local terms.</p>
                <p>Local campaigns need local expertise. We'll target the right postal codes, schedule your ads for when

                <div class="faq-question">How much should I spend on Google Ads?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">It depends on your industry, competition, and goals. Most local businesses we work
                    with spend $1,500-$10,000/month on ads, plus management fees. We'll recommend a budget based on your
                    specific situation and what it'll take to get meaningful data and results.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How much do you charge to manage Google Ads?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Our management fees start at $750/month for smaller accounts and scale based on ad
                    spend and complexity. We're transparent about pricing—you'll know exactly what you're paying before
                    we start. No hidden fees, no long-term contracts required.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How long until I see results?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">You can start getting clicks and leads within days of launching. But it takes 2-3
                    months of data and optimization to really dial in performance. We'll show you results from day one,
                    but the campaigns get better over time as we learn what works.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Should I do Google Ads or SEO?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Ideally, both. Google Ads gives you immediate visibility while SEO builds
                    long-term traffic. If you need leads now, start with ads. If you're thinking long-term, invest in
                    SEO while running ads. We can help you figure out the right mix for your situation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">I already have a Google Ads account. Can you take it over?</div>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes. We'll audit what you have, identify what's working and what's wasting money,
                    and either optimize your existing campaigns or rebuild from scratch—whatever makes more sense. You
                    keep ownership of the account either way.</p>

                    <h3>How an <span>Ontario HVAC company</span> cut their cost per lead in half</h3>
                    <p>This HVAC contractor was spending $12,000/month on Google Ads but getting inconsistent results.
                        Their cost per lead was $127, and half the calls they got weren't even in their service area.
                    </p>
                    <p>We restructured their campaigns with tighter geo-targeting, negative keywords to filter out DIY
                        searchers, and landing pages built for conversions. Within 3 months, their cost per lead dropped
                        to $48 and they were getting 247 qualified leads per month.</p>
